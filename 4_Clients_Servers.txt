Clients and Servers

In general, all of the machines on the Internet can be categorized as two types: servers and clients. 
Those machines that provide services (like Web servers or FTP servers) to other machines are servers. 
And the machines that are used to connect to those services are clients. When you connect to Yahoo! at www.yahoo.com to read a page, 
Yahoo! is providing a machine (probably a cluster of very large machines), for use on the Internet, to service your request. 
Yahoo! is providing a server. Your machine, on the other hand, is probably providing no services to anyone else on the Internet. 
Therefore, it is a user machine, also known as a client. It is possible and common for a machine to be both a server and a client, 
but for our purposes here you can think of most machines as one or the other.

A server machine may provide one or more services on the Internet. For example, a server machine might have software running on it that 
allows it to act as a Web server, an e-mail server and an FTP server. Clients that come to a server machine do so with a specific intent, 
so clients direct their requests to a specific software server running on the overall server machine. For example, if you are running a 
Web browser on your machine, it will most likely want to talk to the Web server on the server machine. Your Telnet application will want 
to talk to the Telnet server, your e-mail application will talk to the e-mail server, and so on...
